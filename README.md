## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accessibility
- BEM 
- Google font
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (developed entirely on my mobile device)

### What I learned

This is my first time using the Block-Element-Modifier (BEM) naming convention in my project and it is clear, helps me maintain consistent styling structure.

```css
/* proud-of-this-css */
    .nft-card__price {
      border-bottom: var(--Border-line);
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
      margin-block-end: 1.3125rem;
    }
```
